    <i><b>IV OF SPADES</b></i> is a Filipino indie rock/funk band formed in 2014.<br> <br>
    The lineup originally consisted of lead guitarist Blaster Silonga, lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Unique Salonga, drummer Badjao De Castro, and bassist and later on became the lead vocalist Zild Benitez. 
    The band was founded by Allan “Daddy A” Silonga, Blaster Silonga’s father, who serves as their manager. They are influenced by a mix of disco, classic rock, and hip-hop. The band is known for their eclectic 70s-inspired outfits and funky beats.<br><br>

    IV OF SPADES’ first major shot at breaking out into the scene as a band was at Wanderband in 2015. 
    They played their first-ever released song “Ilaw Sa Daan”, only to be beat out by Oh, Flamingo! to perform in the following year’s Wanderland Music and Arts Festival. 
    This forced the band into a slump for a brief period.<br><br>
    
    In between, Zild and Blaster joined Eat Bulaga’s Music Hero, a competition among musicians with talent for various instruments. 
    Both competed using their bass and electric guitar respectively, with Blaster eventually coming out as winner and taking home the P500,000 prize—which would help fund the band’s future productions.<br><br>
    
    They released the hit single “Hey Barbara” in 2017, which has garnered over 7 million views on Youtube.
    On May 5, Salonga’s former bandmates Badjao de Castro, Blaster Silonga, and Zild Benitez released a statement that Unique Salonga officially left the band to pursue his personal endeavours. 
    They assured fans that they would continue to perform and produce more music.<br><br><br><hr><br>
